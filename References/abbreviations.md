*[ACM]: Admin Control Mode - A mode of provisioning Intel® AMT that requires a purchased provisioning certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), the creation of a domain, and the creation of a profile in the Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) application.

*[Call Home]: Call Home - A CIRA-enabled technique that managed devices use to remain in contact with the development system. 

*[CCM]: Client Control Mode - An alternative to ACM provisioning mode that does not require a purchased certificate. Use this mode to set up OAMTCT software features quickly.

*[CIRA]: Client Initiated Remote Access - An out-of-band (OOB) management communication protocol that network clients can use to initiate a secure connection with a server. 

*[DNS suffix]: Domain Name System (DNS) suffix - A suffix appended to the hostname of a DNS name.

*[domain suffix]: domain suffix - The top-level portion or end of a domain name (i.e., com, net, org).  

*[Intel® AMT]: Intel® Active Management Technology - A technology that provides out-of-band management and security features on an Intel vPro® platform.

*[KVM]: Keyboard Video Mouse - A technology, often a device, that allows a user to control multiple computers from a single keyboard, mouse, and video source.

*[Intel® MEBX]: Intel® Manageability Engine BIOS Extensions - A BIOS extension that enables the configuration of the Intel® AMT.

*[microservice architecture]: microservice architecture - An architecture in which the component parts are broken into discrete services, called microservices, that perform specific, limited functions. 

*[MPS]: Management Presence Server -  A microservice that resides on the development system and receives CIRA requests from the managed device. 

*[OOB Management]: Out-of-band Management - A remote management technology that allows administrators to perform actions on network assets or devices using a secure alternative to LAN-based communication protocols.

*[Open AMT Cloud Toolkit]: Open Active Management Technology Cloud Tookit - open source modular microservices and libraries for integration of Intel® Active Management Technology.

*[Profile]: Profile - A set of configuration information, including a password and provisioning method, provided to Intel® AMT firmware during the activation process. 

*[RPC]: Remote Provision Client - A lightweight client application that resides on the managed device and communicates with the Manageability Engine Interface (MEI) to activate Intel AMT. 

*[RPS]: Remote Provisioning Server - A node.js-based microservice that works with the Remote Provision Client (RPC) to activate Intel® AMT using a pre-defined profile.

*[REST]: REpresentational State Transfer - An architectural style or set of rules describing constraints that allow administrators and developers to take advantage of various Web services. In the context of OAMTCT, administrators can construct REST API calls and run them with node, use provided REST code snippets to expand the reference implementation console, and use provided REST code snippets as a springboard for developing and expanding custom consoles.

*[Sample Web UI]: Sample Web UI - A reference UI implementation serving as a demo vehicle and utilizing components of the UI toolkit.

*[UI Toolkit]: UI Toolkit - A modular, REST-based API consisting of code snippets developers can use to implement AMT features and services to their manageability console.
