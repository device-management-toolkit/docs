*[ACM]: Admin Control Mode - A mode of provisioning Intel® AMT that requires a purchased provisioning certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), the creation of a domain, and the creation of a profile in the Remote Provisioning Server (RPS).

*[Call Home]: Call Home - A CIRA-enabled technique that managed devices use to remain in contact with the Management Presence Server. 

*[CCM]: Client Control Mode - An alternative to ACM provisioning mode that does not require a purchased certificate. User Consent is required for redirection features. Use this mode to set up OAMTCT software features quickly.

*[CIRA]: Client Initiated Remote Access - An out-of-band (OOB) management communication protocol that network clients can use to initiate a secure connection with a server. 

*[curl]: command line URL - A command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

*[DNS suffix]: Domain Name System (DNS) suffix - A suffix appended to the hostname of a DNS name.

*[Domain Profile]: Domain Profile - A profile enabling the remote activation of an Intel® AMT device into Admin Control Mode.

*[domain suffix]: domain suffix - The top-level portion or end of a domain name (i.e., com, net, org).  

*[AKS]: Azure Kubernetes Service - A scaling service for deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster.

*[Intel® AMT]: Intel® Active Management Technology - A technology that provides out-of-band management and security features on an Intel vPro® Platform.

*[KVM]: Keyboard Video Mouse - A feature that allows a user to control the keyboard, mouse, and video inputs/outputs of a remote device.

*[Intel® MEBX]: Intel® Manageability Engine BIOS Extensions - A BIOS extension that enables the configuration of Intel® AMT.

*[microservice architecture]: microservice architecture - An architecture in which the component parts are broken into discrete services, called microservices, that perform specific, limited functions. 

*[MPS]: Management Presence Server - A microservice that executes OOB Management REST APIs and receives keep-alive CIRA requests from managed devices. 

*[MQTT]: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport - A lightweight publisher / subscriber network protocol for transfering messages between devices.

*[OOB Management]: Out-of-band Management - A remote, hardware-based management technology that allows administrators to perform actions on network assets or devices using a secure alternative to LAN-based communication protocols regardless of OS state.

*[Open AMT Cloud Toolkit]: Open Active Management Technology Cloud Toolkit - open source modular microservices and libraries for integration of Intel® Active Management Technology.

*[Profile]: Profile - A set of configuration information, including a password and provisioning method, provided to Intel® AMT firmware during the activation process. 

*[RPC]: Remote Provision Client - A lightweight client application on the managed device that communicates with the Manageability Engine Interface (MEI) to activate Intel® AMT using a configuration from RPS. 

*[RPS]: Remote Provisioning Server - A microservice that works with the Remote Provision Client (RPC) to activate Intel® AMT using pre-defined profiles.

*[REST]: REpresentational State Transfer - An architectural style or set of rules describing constraints that allow administrators and developers to take advantage of various Web services. In the context of OAMTCT, developers can construct REST API calls, use provided REST APIs to expand the reference implementation console, and use provided REST APIs as a springboard for developing and expanding custom consoles.

*[Sample Web UI]: Sample Web UI - A reference UI implementation serving as a demo vehicle and utilizing components of the UI toolkit.

*[SOL]: Serial over LAN: A feature that enables the input and output of the serial port of a managed system to be redirected over IP.

*[TLS]: Transport Layer Security - A protocol for encrypting network traffic.

*[UI Toolkit]: UI Toolkit - A modular, REST-based API consisting of code snippets developers can use to implement KVM and SOL features to their manageability console. 

*[Webpack]: A module bundler that packages various assets and files (e.g., CSS, JS, JPG, etc.).
