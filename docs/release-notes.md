!!! note "Note From the Team"

    Still looking for a Valentine's date? Open AMT will always be here for you!

    With the team fully back and the year in full swing now, we've started to tackle some of our big priorities. At the start of this year, that means expanding our ability to support more enterprise-type environments and deployment scenarios.

    To do that, we are taking a close look at RPC-Go and expanding the features available locally without needing a remote server like RPS.  Right now, we offer basic activation and some configuration (like wireless profiles). But, we want to enable additional configuration options like TLS, 802.1x, and much more! 
    
    *Best Wishes,* 

    *The Open AMT Cloud Toolkit Team*


## What's New?

:material-new-box: **Feature: RPC-Go Local TLS Configuration**

TLS can now be configured locally on the device with RPC-Go with a new `configure` subcommand.  This current implementation uses a self-signed TLS certificate generated by RPC-Go.

In the future, additional options such as passing a self-signed certificate or fetching a CA-signed certificate using Enterprise Assistant will be available.

```
rpc configure tls -mode Server -password AMTPassword
```

[See the documentation for additional details](./Reference/RPC/commandsRPC.md#tls)

:material-new-box: **Enhancement: RPC-Go `-local` Logging**

With the expansion of new `-local` features, we wanted to make sure as much logging is provided as possible to aid in any development and debugging. Using the `-v` (verbose) or `-l` (loglevel) flags when running a local command will now provide much greater detail of the communication between RPC-Go and AMT.

This level of detail should now look much more similar those familiar with the logging when using RPC-Go with a remote server like RPS.
