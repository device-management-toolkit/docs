# Release Notes

!!! note "Note From the Team"
    Hey Everyone,

    It has been a long few months since our last communicated release, and I want to take a moment to acknowledge that. Our team here at Intel has been through a number of changesâ€”some exciting, others bittersweet. Weâ€™ve had to say goodbye to several valued colleagues, and we are deeply grateful for their contributions.  

    You may also have noticed that weâ€™ve paused our monthly video updates. We know they provide useful insights into our work and roadmap; however, our focus has shifted to ensure we are getting our features out in a timely manner.

    The work itself has never stopped. Development for version **3.0** is moving forward strongly, and weâ€™re excited about the features in this release. While this is the first formal communication since March, we want to remind you that we continuously ship updates as features are developed. Be sure to check the repositories regularly for the latest tagged versions.  

    We encourage you to reach out to us on Discord with questions, feedback, or suggestions. This project has always been about building together with the community, and we greatly value your input.  

    *Best wishes,*  
    **Mike Johanson**  
    Lead Developer / Architect  
    The Device Management Toolkit Team  

## ðŸš€ What's New?

:material-new-box: Feature: Multiâ€‘monitor KVM

You can switch between displays during an AMT KVM session without dropping the connection. 

:material-new-box: Feature: Local PBA and Windows Recovery in One-Click Recovery (OCR)

Kick off local Preâ€‘Boot Application (PBA) and Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) directly from the UI or API. This pairs well with HTTPS Network Boot so you can standardize remote recovery, even when the OS is down.

:material-new-box: Enhancement: Clearer OCR flows

- HTTPS Network Boot now includes clearer prompts and tooltips, plus an optional Power up action to start from a full off state.
- OCR status is richer endâ€‘toâ€‘end (HTTP, WinRE, PBA) so you can see whatâ€™s happening at a glance.
- UEFI Wiâ€‘Fi credential sync helps devices connect in preâ€‘boot scenarios.

:material-new-box: Feature: Secure Hostâ€‘Based Configuration (ACM/SHBC)

Provision devices securely with hostâ€‘based configuration. We added CLI support and safer serverâ€‘side handling so failed ACM attempts clean up cleanly instead of leaving devices in limbo.

:material-new-box: Feature: Certificate and profile management

- List and add AMT certificates through the server API to simplify rotation.
- Export local profiles from the provisioning service to back up or migrate fleets.
- Specify a Postgres SSL certificate path to meet stricter database security policies.

:material-new-box: Enhancement: Connectivity, performance, and stability

- Configure Local CIRA for flexible network setups.
- Increased CIRA window size reduces chattiness on highâ€‘latency links.
- Better KVM behavior when switching encodings and when combining SOL/IDER.
- Hardening in the CLI prevents panics on bad URLs and allows skipping AMT cert verification when appropriate.


## âœ… Resolved Issues

Fixed several KVM stability issues when switching encoding or combining SOL/IDER connections.

Corrected certificate upload statuses in the Sample Web UI and devices view.

Addressed multiple OCRâ€‘related UI inconsistencies and status reporting gaps.

Fixed panic scenarios in RPCâ€‘Go with invalid RPS URLs.

Numerous small bug fixes across MPS, RPS, and UI Toolkit.

## ðŸ”­ Open Issues and Requests

We continue to track feedback on extending OCR workflows in enterprise recovery environments.

Community requests around enhanced logging and audit compliance are under evaluation.

Improvements to bulk device provisioning and performance tuning are planned for follow-up releases.
