## The wait is over â€“ Console v1.0 is officially released!

Weâ€™re excited to announce the official release of Device Management Toolkit: Console v1.0! Download the latest v1.x release to access the most stable version and stay tuned for further improvements.

Console is an open-source management application that enables IT administrators to manage IntelÂ® AMT devices within on-premises environments (or private networks). It provides direct access to activated AMT devices, enabling functions such as power control, remote keyboard-video-mouse (KVM), hardware inventory, and more.
