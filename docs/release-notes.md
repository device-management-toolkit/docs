# Release Notes

!!! note "Note From the Team"
    Hey Everyone,

    It has been a long few months since our last communicated release, and I want to take a moment to acknowledge that. Our team here at Intel has been through a number of changesâ€”some exciting, others bittersweet. Weâ€™ve had to say goodbye to several valued colleagues, and we are deeply grateful for their contributions.  

    You may also have noticed that weâ€™ve paused our monthly video updates. We know they provide useful insights into our work and roadmap; however, our focus has shifted to ensure we are getting our features out in a timely manner.

    The work itself has never stopped. Development for version **3.0** is moving forward strongly, and weâ€™re excited about the features in this release. While this is the first formal communication since March, we want to remind you that we continuously ship updates as features are developed. Be sure to check the repositories regularly for the latest tagged versions.  

    We encourage you to reach out to us on Discord with questions, feedback, or suggestions. This project has always been about building together with the community, and we greatly value your input.  

    *Best wishes,*  
    **Mike Johanson**
    Lead Developer / Architect  
    The Device Management Toolkit Team  

## ðŸš€ What's New?

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: Multi-Monitor KVM

You can now switch between multiple displays during an active AMT KVM session without disconnecting. This makes remote troubleshooting on multi-monitor systems seamless and efficient.

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: One-Click Recovery (OCR)

One-Click Recovery (OCR) allows IT administrators to remotely trigger a secure and reliable boot to a recovery application, environment, or network boot, ensuring recovery from system failures with minimum downtime.

Device Management Toolkit (DMT) now supports the complete One-Click Recovery (OCR) feature set across both cloud and enterprise deployments. Supported Recovery Options include:

- UEFI HTTPS Network Boot â€“ Securely boot a recovery image over HTTPS.
- Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) â€“ Access Windows repair and troubleshooting tools.
- Local Pre-Boot Application (PBA) â€“ Launch a locally installed diagnostic or recovery utility.

See the [MPS](https://device-management-toolkit.github.io/docs/2.28/Tutorials/ocrTutorial/) and [Console](https://device-management-toolkit.github.io/docs/2.28/Reference/Console/Features/ocr/) guides for setup details.

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: KVM Hot-Key Support

You can now send common keyboard shortcuts directly through the KVM interface for faster remote troubleshooting and configuration. The UI provides predefined options to send hot-key combinations such as `Ctrl + Alt + Del`, `Alt + Tab`, `Win + R`, and others, making it easier to perform essential actions during remote sessions.

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: Proxy Configuration Support

Customer environments with devices behind a proxy can now define proxy settings (address, port, and credentials) as part of AMT configuration profiles. This enables AMT to connect to MPS or a cloud service over a proxy, ensuring secure and compliant network routing.

Thanks to contributions from `Blanca Ortega` and `Fernando Madrigal` for this feature.

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: Secure Hostâ€‘Based Configuration (SHBC)

Provision supported platforms securely over mTLS to ACM using RPC-Go local activation. Failed ACM attempts are now cleaned up automatically, preventing devices from getting stuck in partial configuration states and ensuring a smoother provisioning experience.

### :material-new-box:{ .icon-new } Feature: Certificate and profile management

- List and add AMT certificates through the server API to simplify rotation.
- Export local profiles from the provisioning service to back up or migrate fleets.

## :material-speedometer:{ .icon-perf } Quality of Life Improvements

- Increased CIRA window size to maintain a larger buffer and improve KVM performance during remote sessions.
- Improved KVM behavior when switching encodings or combining SOL/IDER sessions.
- Strengthened CLI handling for invalid URLs and added an option to skip AMT certificate verification.
- Added support to specify a PostgreSQL SSL certificate path for stricter database security.
- Introduced Local CIRA configuration, an important step towards the 3.0 architecture.

## :material-checkbox-marked:{ .icon-new } Resolved Issues

This release includes security updates, stability improvements, and bug fixes across MPS, RPS, RPC-Go, UI-Toolkit, and other components.

Below are a few key highlights:

- Fixed KVM stability issues when switching encoding or combining SOL/IDER connections.
- Fixed issue where SOL sessions did not display the BIOS screen after performing a Reset to BIOS action.
- Corrected certificate upload statuses in the Sample-Web-UI and devices view.
- Fixed panic scenarios in RPCâ€‘Go with invalid RPS URLs.

## :material-handshake:{ .icon-handshake } Community Contributions

Special thanks to our community contributors `@jclab-joseph` and `@KalleDK` for minor bug fixes in this release. We appreciate their contributions!

## :material-arrow-up-bold:{ .icon-upgrade } Upgrade Path

This release includes schema changes specific to RPS. Before deploying the latest RPS image, follow the steps in the [Upgrade Guide](https://device-management-toolkit.github.io/docs/2.28/Deployment/upgradeVersion/) to apply the necessary database updates.

## :material-alert-circle-outline:{ .icon-opens } Open Issues and Requests

- **Bulk Provisioning & Performance:** Enhancements to bulk device provisioning, registration, and performance tuning are planned for upcoming releases.

- **Logging & Compliance:** Community requests for improved logging and audit compliance are currently under evaluation.

- **OCR Workflows:** We continue to gather feedback and make iterative improvements to OCR workflows.
