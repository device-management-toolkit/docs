# Device Management Toolkit (formerly known as Open AMT Cloud Toolkit)

!!! warning
    Our GitHub organization has been renamed from open-amt-cloud-toolkit to device-management-toolkit to better reflect its broader scope beyond Intel AMT in the future. This change aligns with our goal of supporting a wider range of device management capabilities while maintaining the same core functionality and open-source commitment. Please bear with us as we take the time to update the name throughout our project. 


**Device Management Toolkit** offers open-source microservices, applications and libraries designed to simplify and accelerate the integration of Intel’s out-of-band management technology (vPro® AMT) into software solutions.

## Overview

Device Management Toolkit was built with flexibility in mind. Developers can integrate APIs to enable key Intel AMT remote management features, like power control and remote Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) control, into their existing management console solution. Alternatively, users can adopt Console, an application offering 1:1 direct connection of AMT devices on on-premises/private networks.

Our open-source services and applications can be adopted, customized, and used to fit your specific use cases, requirements, and network needs.

## Out-of-Band Remote Manageability

The Intel vPro® Platform, featuring Intel® AMT, enables Out-of-Band (OOB) Management for remote devices. No matter if the device is powered off or the operating system has crashed, issue power actions and take over keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) control.

Reduce the need for costly on-site IT, minimize the downtime of key, business-critical devices, and more. [Read more about the Intel vPro® Platform](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/hardware/vpro-platform-retail.html).
