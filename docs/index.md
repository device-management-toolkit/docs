# Overview

 [**Open Active Management Technology (Open AMT) Cloud Toolkit**](Glossary.md#o) provides open-source, modular microservices and libraries for integration of hardware provisioning, [out-of-band (OOB) manageability](Glossary.md#o), and other [Intel® Active Management Technology (Intel® AMT)](Glossary.md#i). As an open source implementation, the toolkit makes it easier for IT departments and independent software vendors (ISVs) to adopt, integrate, and customize out-of-band management solutions for [Intel vPro® platforms](Glossary.md#i).

## Goals
The toolkit guide provides instructions to:

- Deploy the [Management Presence Server (MPS)](Glossary.md#m) and [Remote Provisioning Server (RPS)](Glossary.md#r) on the development system.
- Build and run [Remote Provisioning Client (RPC)](Glossary.md#r)on the managed device.
- Connect the managed device (edge device)

Additional sections provide guidance on the reference implementation UI Toolkit, REST API usage, asset security, and more.

 **Figure 2: High-level architecture consists of four major software components.**

As shown in Figure 2, Open AMT Cloud Toolkit high-level architecture consists of four components:

1. **MPS** - A microservice that uses an Intel vPro® platform feature, Client Initiated Remote Access (CIRA), for enabling edge, cloud devices to maintain a persistent connection for out-of-band manageability features, such as power control or Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) control.
2. **RPS** - A microservice that activates Intel® AMT platforms using predefined profiles and connects them to the MPS for manageability use cases.
3. **RPC** - A lightweight client application that communicates with the RPS server to activate Intel® AMT.
4. **UI Toolkit** - A toolkit that includes prebuilt React components and a reference implementation web console. The React-based snippets simplify the task of adding complex manageability-related UI controls, such as the KVM, to a console. 
5. **Sample Web UI** - A web based UI that demonstrates how to use the UI-Toolkit. It also provides a way to interact with the microservices and to help provide context as to how each microservice is used.
   
Integrate the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit into new and existing management consoles, software solutions, and more.

## Open AMT Cloud Toolkit Setup

### Build and Deploy Microservices Locally
If unfamiliar with Docker*, choose this setup option to accomplish a manual, local installation of microservices. 

[Get Started with Local Microservices](Local/overview.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary }


Estimated completion time: **Approximately 15 minutes**

### Build and Deploy Microservices with Local Docker* Images

If familiar with Docker, choose this setup option to install microservices as local Docker images. This option is an especially good choice for development systems with Docker already installed.

[Get Started with Microservices as Docker Images](Docker/overview.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary }


Estimated completion time: **Approximately 15 minutes**

Both build-and-deploy options install microservices locally on a development system. The client application is installed on a managed device. Experienced Docker users may choose to deploy microservices straight to the [cloud](Docker/dockerCloud.md).
