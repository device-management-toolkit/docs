## A

**Admin Control Mode (ACM):** A mode of provisioning Intel® AMT that requires a purchased provisioning certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), the creation of a domain, and the creation of a profile in the Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) application. ACM achieves a higher level of trust than client control mode (CCM). This is the required mode for Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) or Redirection without user consent. See also [CCM](#c) and [provisioning](#p).

**ACM Activation:** The act of loading a purchased certificate and associating it with an OAMTCT profile.

**Allowlist:** A list permitting access to a privilege, service, network, etc.

## B

**Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):** Firmware that performs hardware] initialization and configuration upon startup. See [MEBX](#m).

## C

**Certificate Authority (CA -or Certification Authority-):** It is an entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates. It is referred as a Certificate Vendor as well. The [Intel® AMT firmware](#i) is pre-loaded with Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate thumbprints of different certificate vendors.

**Certificate (Provisioning):** A digitally signed document used in the provisioning of an edge device featuring Intel® AMT. The Intel® AMT firmware is pre-loaded with Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate thumbprints of different certificate vendors. A digital certificate binds the identity of the certificate holder to vendor-specific thumbprints. To provision an edge device, users must purchase a certificate from an approved vendor.

**Client Initiated Remote Access (CIRA):** An out-of-band (OOB) management communication protocol that network clients can use to initiate a secure connection with a server.

**Client Control Mode (CCM):** An alternative to ACM provisioning mode that does not require a purchased certificate. Use this mode to set up OAMTCT software features quickly.

**Console:** It is an application providing a 1:1, direct connection for Intel AMT devices for use in an enterprise environment. It supports multiple features such as power control, remote keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) control, and device monitoring. [See console project for more information.](https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/console)

**Container (Docker*):** The instantiation, or running instance, of a Docker image.

**Custom Certificate (Provisioning):** It is a custom certificate created by an ad-hoc Certificate Authority (i.e., untrusted) for development purposes only. It could be used to provision an edge device featuring Intel® AMT. However, they are not pre-loaded in the Intel® AMT firmware, so the user (or developer) needs to incorporate them manually (for example, using the USBFile utility of the [Intel AMT SDK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/704388/intel-active-management-technology-intel-amt-software-development-kit-sdk.html)). To provision an edge device, users must purchase a certificate from an approved vendor.

## D

**Development System:** The system on which Management Presence Server (MPS) and Remote Provision Server (RPS) are installed.
