The [Remote Provisioning Service (RPS)](../Glossary.md#r) is a microservice based on Node.js*. The RPS works with the [Remote Provisioning Client (RPC)](../Glossary.md#r) to activate IntelÂ® AMT platforms using a pre-defined profile.

Figure 1 illustrates where RPS fits into the overall [microservice architecture.](../Glossary.md#m)

## Clone OpenAMT Cloud Toolkit

**To clone the repositories:**

Note: Skip this step if the repositories are already cloned.

1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to a directory of your choice for development.
``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/open-amt-cloud-toolkit
```
2. Navigate to the rps directory
``` bash
cd open-amt-cloud-toolkit\rps
```


!!! Warning
    Do not nest a microservice directory inside another microservice directory. The source code contains relative paths. The correct directory structure appears below, where *parent* is your installation directory.
    
```
ðŸ“¦parent
 â”£ ðŸ“‚mps
 â”— ðŸ“‚rps
```


## Start the RPS Server

**To start the RPS:**

1. In the ```rps``` directory, run the install command to install all required dependencies.
