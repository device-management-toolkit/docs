Profiles provide configuration information to the AMT Firmware during the activation process with the Remote Provisioning Client (RPC). Profiles also distinguish between activating in: 

**[Client Control Mode (CCM):](createProfileCCM.md)** This mode offers nearly all manageability features including, but not limited to, power control, audit logs, and hardware info. **While IntelÂ® AMT includes redirection features such as KVM while using user consent in CCM, the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit does not currently support doing so.**

**[Admin Control Mode (ACM):](createProfileACM.md)** ACM mode supports all manageability features **without requiring user consent**. This means it is **not necessary** to have a person on-site to remote in and manage an edge device. In most IoT use cases, edge devices such as digital signage or kiosks may not be easily accessible or have available employees nearby. ACM mode proves immensely helpful in these scenarios.
