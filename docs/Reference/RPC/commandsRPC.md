On the managed device, a Remote Provisioning Client (RPC) communicates with the Remote Provision Server (RPS) in the process of activating or deactivating the device. In addition to activation and deactivation, the RPC provides informational and maintenance commands.

##List Commands
On the managed device, open a Terminal (Linux) or Powershell/Command Prompt **as Administrator** (Windows).

Run the RPC application on the command line with no arguments to see supported commands:

=== "Linux"
    ``` bash
    sudo ./rpc 
    ```
=== "Windows"
    ```
    .\rpc
    ```

| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| activate | Activate this device with a specified profile | ./rpc activate -u wss://server/activate --profile profilename  |
| deactivate | Deactivate this device. You will be prompted for the AMT password.  | ./rpc deactivate -u wss://server/activate |
| maintenance | Synchronize the managed device's AMT clock with operating system time | ./rpc maintenance -c -u wss://server/activate -n |
| amtinfo | Display AMT status and configuration | ./rpc amtinfo |
| version | Display the current version of RPC and the RPC Protocol version | ./rpc version |

### amtinfo

 Display AMT status and configuration

=== "Linux"
    ``` bash
    sudo ./rpc amtinfo
    ```

| AMT INFO &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | DESCRIPTION &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | 
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Version | Intel AMT version.  | 
| Build Number | Intel AMT Build Number. | 
| SKU | | 
| UUID | Unique Universal Identifier of the device. Used when creating device-specific MPS API calls as part of the REST API's URL path. | 
| Control Mode |  Control Mode below indicates the managed device's state: a) pre-provisioning or deactivated (b) activated in **client control mode** (c) activated in **admin control mode** | 
|DNS Suffix | DNS Suffix set according to PKI DNS Suffix in Intel MEBX or through DHCP Option 15. Requried for ACM activation. |
|DNS Suffix (OS)| |
|Hostname (OS) | Device's hostname as set in the Operating System. |
|RAS Network | |
|RAS Remote Status | Unconnected or connected. State of connection to a management server. |
|RAS Trigger| User initiated or periodic. When activated, periodic signifies CIRA established. By default, CIRA sends a heartbeat to the server every 30 seconds to verify and maintain connection. |
