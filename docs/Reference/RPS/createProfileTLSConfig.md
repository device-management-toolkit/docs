During the activation process with the Remote Provisioning Client (RPC), profiles provide configuration information to the firmware on platforms featuring Intel® AMT.

In **Profiles**, the Device Management Toolkit supports Client Initiated Remote Access (CIRA) connections, which use Transport Layer Security (TLS). The toolkit also supports TLS without CIRA. TLS connections encrypt Intel® AMT network traffic, increasing data security and privacy.

!!! Important
    * TLS works with both ACM And CCM.
    * Because CIRA connections already use TLS, the option to use both in a profile is not available, as it would double the amount of encryption/decryption and potentially impact performance.


**To create a profile with TLS Config:**

1. Select the **Profiles** tab from the menu on the left.

2. Under the **Profiles** tab, click **+ Add New** in the top-right corner to create a profile.

    </figure>

3. Specify a **Profile Name** of your choice.

4. Under **Activation Mode**, select either **Client Control Mode** or **Admin Control Mode** from the dropdown menu.

5. Enable desired redirection features for the profile under **AMT Features - Enable/Disable features**. 

6. Provide or generate a strong **AMT Password**. AMT will verify this password when receiving a command from a MPS server. This password is also required for device deactivation.

    !!! tip
        The two buttons next to the password input are for toggling visibility and generating a new random password. Please note that **if the Vault database is lost or corrupted, all credentials that aren't also stored somewhere else will be lost.** There will be no way to login. The administrator will have to clear the CMOS battery on the managed devices!
   
7. If choosing to activate into ACM, provide or generate a strong **MEBX Password**. This password can be used to access Intel® Manageability Engine BIOS Extensions (Intel® MEBX) on the AMT device.

8. Leave DHCP as the default for **Network Configuration**.

9. This express setup assumes the managed device (i.e. AMT device) is on a wired connection for quickest setup.  To learn more about a Wireless Setup, see the [Wireless Activation Tutorial](../../Tutorials/createWiFiConfig.md).

10. Select **Connection Configuration** to **TLS (Enterprise)**.

11. Under **TLS (Enterprise)**, select the **TLS Mode from** the dropdown menu. 
    
    The toolkit offers two configuration modes: 

    | CONFIGURATION MODE           | DESCRIPTION                           |
    | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
    | Server Authentication Only | The client authenticates the server request and accepts only those servers with a digital certificate. |
    | Server and Non-TLS Authentication | **Used primarily for testing.** The client authenticates the server request and accepts legitimate digital certificates from TLS-enabled servers. However, if the server is not TLS-enabled, the client defaults to a CIRA connection.|
    
    <!-- | Mutual TLS Authentication Only | Both client and server **must** have certs. The client cert is signed by the server cert. |
    | Mutual and Non-TLS Authentication | **Used primarily for testing.** Both client and server certs are expected. The client authenticates the server request and accepts legitimate digital certificates from TLS-enabled servers. However, if the server is not TLS-enabled, the client defaults to a CIRA connection.   | -->

12. Optionally, add **Tags** to help in organizing and querying devices as your list of managed devices grow.

13. Click **Save.**

         </figure>

14. To confirm the digital certificates generated for the profile, open a browser and navigate to the Vault service at:

    - [http://localhost:8200](http://localhost:8200) for a local Docker deployment
    - http://[Cloud-FQDN]:8200 (Ex: http://openamt.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8200) for a cloud deployment

15. Sign in to Vault with the `VAULT_TOKEN` stored in the .env file or Root Token (Ex: hvs.QnhrbjXyH08UD7y6PHBDmjq9) generated when unsealing and initializing Vault in your cloud deployment.

    </figure>

16. Navigate to the path `secret/TLS/[profile name]` for a local dev mode Vault deployment. Or `kv/TLS/[profile name]` for a cloud deployment.
