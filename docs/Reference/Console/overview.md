Console is an open-source management application that enables IT administrators to manage Intel® AMT devices within on-premises environments (or private networks). Once an AMT device is activated, it can be added to Console, allowing administrators to establish a secure 1:1 direct connection for performing out-of-band management operations.

With Console, IT administrators can access detailed system information and perform essential management tasks, including power control, hardware inventory, and KVM-based remote access.
