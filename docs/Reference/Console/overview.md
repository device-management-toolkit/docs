!!! warning "Warning - Console in Beta Development"
    Console is currently under development. The current available tags for download are Beta version code. This could mean that certain features may not function yet, visual look and feel may change, or bugs/errors may occur. It is not recommended for use in Production deployments. Follow along our [Feature Backlog for future releases and feature updates](https://github.com/orgs/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/projects/10)

Console is an open-source management application that allows IT administrators to manage IntelÂ® AMT devices within on-premises environments (or private networks). It provides direct access to activated AMT devices, enabling functions such as power control, remote keyboard-video-mouse (KVM), hardware inventory, and more.

RPC-Go can perform activation and configuration of Intel AMT locally. Using Enterprise Assistant, RPC-Go can also securely configure 802.1x and TLS, if required, based on existing network requirements.

After a device is activated, the device can be added into Console with the device's hostname and AMT credentials. Once added, users can view device information and perform out-of-band management operations, such as power control, on the device.

## Get Started

Set up Console quickly and get a device connected.
