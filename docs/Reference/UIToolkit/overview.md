UI Toolkit React is an open-source library of prebuilt React components for adding Intel® AMT manageability features to web applications. It provides three core controls:

- **KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse)** — Control a platform remotely using a remote keyboard and mouse while viewing the managed platform's screen output on a remote monitor.
- **SOL (Serial Over LAN)** — Serial terminal access for BIOS-level interaction.
- **IDER (IDE Redirection)** — Mount and stream local disk images (ISO/IMG) to a remote device.

## Get Started
